/* 
Given an array of non-negative integers and a positive number x, determing if there exists a subset with sum = x
eg - arr = [3,2,7,1] x = 6 -> subset = [3,2,1]


Algorithm - 
* We can iterate through the array and at each iteration we can either include current item or exclude it.
  * If we include it then we need to search the rest of array for Sum - arr[i]
  * If we exclude it then we need to search the rest of array for Sum
* Recurrence relation -
  * f(i, sum) = f(i-1, sum-arr[i]) || f(i-1, sum) ðŸ’¡kinda like knapsack.js but without taking profit into account
* Terminating conditions -
  * if sum == 0 we found the subset cuz we kept decreasing so, return true
  * if i < 0, we reached the end but didnt find the sum so, return false
