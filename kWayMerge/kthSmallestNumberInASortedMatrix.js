// one solution is the same as finding kth smallest number in sorted lists, but, in this problem even the columns are sorted, so we need try to use binary search

const getSmallestNumber = (matrix, k) => {}

console.log(
  getSmallestNumber(
    [
      [2, 6, 8],
      [3, 7, 10],
      [5, 8, 11],
    ],
    5,
  ),
)
