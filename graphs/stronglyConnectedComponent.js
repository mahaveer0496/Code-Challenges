/*
  SCCS is part of a Graph in which each vertex can be visited from any other vertex in that sub graph (basically self contained cycles ðŸ’¡)

  Kosaraju's Algorithm -
  * Initialise Visited Set and a Stack 
  * For each vertex
    * if visited -> do nothing  
    * else Start DFS with that vertex
      * When entering a vertex put it into Visited 
    * Once a vertex's DFS is done, put it into Stack
  * Generate Graph's Transpose (GT) (Reverse all edges)
  * Initialise SCC = []
  * For each Item in stack
    * Pop Stack's item
      * if item in visited -> do nothing
      * else Do DFS for that vertex 
        * When entering a vertex put it into Visited and SCC array
